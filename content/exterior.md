The cabin's exterior tells tales of age and magic. Made of silvered wooden planks, it has seen countless seasons pass. Moss and ivy climb the walls, reaching towards the roof made of thatch, which houses a chimney that intermittently emits a curious purple smoke.

Guarding the entrance is an ancient wooden door, adorned with intricate carvings of moon phases and mystical symbols, revealing its protective enchantments. The windows, although few, are framed with delicate lace curtains that give glimpses of shimmering lights dancing within.

Beside the cabin, a small pond reflects the mysteries of the night sky. And just a few steps away, an old stone well stands, its depths rumored to hold not water, but potions and ancient relics.
