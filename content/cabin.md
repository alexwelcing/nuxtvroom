Deep within the heart of a secluded forest lies the Witch's Cabin, an ancient dwelling that has stood for centuries. Surrounded by towering trees with gnarled branches and tangled roots, the cabin is both a refuge and a fortress. It is said that the cabin has a life of its own, ever-changing with the seasons, and whispering secrets of old to those who dare approach.
