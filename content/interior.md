Upon entering the cabin, one is immediately embraced by the warmth of a crackling hearth and the scent of dried herbs hanging from the ceiling. Shelves upon shelves are lined with old books, potion bottles, and curious artifacts from distant lands.

In the center of the main room, a large wooden table stands, scattered with tools of the craft - a cauldron, candles of various colors, and a crystal ball that often swirls with mist. The walls are adorned with tapestries depicting ancient rituals and celestial events.

To the left, a narrow stairway spirals up to a loft where the witch rests and dreams. Below, a trapdoor leads to a cellar, its contents known only to the witch herself. Every corner of the cabin is imbued with magic, whispers of incantations, and the presence of spirits from realms beyond.
